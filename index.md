## Time Sync Study

This is the project repository website for UCLA ECE 209 AS-2 Winter. The project will be focusing on mitigating faulty time stamps on data which can cause accuracy loss on learning models.

### Deliverables

Inaccurate time stamps on data can cause accuracy loss on models that try to classify a series of actions. Many works have focused on training models that try to be resilient to bad time stamps, but these models can only learn delays up to a certain amount. Other works try to tackle the source of the problem and minimize the error by providing a more accurate clock.
